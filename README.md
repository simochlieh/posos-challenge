# POSOS challenge
This repo contains the code and material from the posos challenge as presented in https://challengedata.ens.fr/fr/challenge/33/predisez_la_reponse_attendue.html
## Challenge description
Millions of questions are asked every year about drugs. There is a limited number of query types but the same question could be asked in many ways. Therefore, understanding what information people expect when asking a question is a great challenge. The goal of Posos’ challenge is to predict for each question its associated intent.
